# Nihilo

Nihilo is an N-body simulation made as a hobby to practice my C++ and OpenGL skills.
It aims to be fast and proposes different laws of motion (classic or relativist) as well as different integrations (Euler, Runge Kutta 4 or Verlet).

**This project is still Work In Progress.**

Developer: Hugo Dupanloup
